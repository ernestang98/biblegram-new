# Biblegram

Mini-project so that I don't become a washed-up software engineer that doesn't how to write brainless react code :). Template adopted from [jlumbroso](https://github.com/jlumbroso/wordle-react-clone/tree/main/src)

### How to play?

Complete the Bible verse. Missing characters are hinted using certain cryptographic cyphers.

### Environment

- npm  8.19.4

- node 16.20.2

- yarn 1.22.22

### For everybody's learning

- [React useCallback()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxIPQZ64x0I&ab_channel=CosdenSolutions) 

    - I think it's a wrapper to prevent rerendering of react components?
